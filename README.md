Hi there, I'm Nafisah Adams ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Data Science Analytics student with a passion for leveraging technology to solve real-world problems.
My journey in tech started with a strong foundation in graphic design and programming, and has expanded into data analytics,
automation, and software development. I'm currently pursuing a BSc. in Data Science Analytics at United States International University-Africa, 
where I'm on track to graduate with First Class Honors.

I have hands-on experience with a variety of tools, including Microsoft PowerBI, Excel, and Python, and I've honed my skills in both low-code and no-code platforms
to automate business operations efficiently. My commitment to continuous learning keeps me updated with the latest industry trends and helps me expand my skill set.

Beyond academics, I'm deeply involved in volunteer work, including mentoring high school students and delivering IT workshops at Noni Hub IT Academy in Ghana.
My leadership roles and community service have been recognized with several honors, including being named a Millennium Fellow and receiving the MasterCard Foundation Scholarship.

Feel free to explore my projects and connect with me if you share similar interests in data science, automation, and community development!# Nafisah-Adams
